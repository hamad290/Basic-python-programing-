Numpy(Array & Matrices)
Scipy(optimization and Solving Dufferent equation)

DATA VISUALIZATION:
Matplotlib
->Plot, Graph and Figures
Seaborn
->heat Maps, Time series and other plotes.

MACHINE LEARNING AlGORITHUM DEVELPMENT:
Scikit-learn
->Machines learing: regression classification clustering analysis and so on....

Statmodels

-count (plot type)
-Male vs felmale
